Welcome to ``neurosym``'s documentation!
===========================================

The `neurosym` library is a Python package for neurosymbolic program synthesis. We aim to provide a set of tools for DSL design, program search, and program abstraction in a self-contained package, allowing researchers to reuse DSLs, datasets, and algorithmic components across different research projects.
