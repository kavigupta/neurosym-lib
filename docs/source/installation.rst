Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

You should generally be familiar with Program Synthesis. 

These guides should give you a general idea of the program synthesis problem:

- `Program Synthesis Explained <https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/post/synthesis-explained.html>`_.
- `A minimalist guide to program synthesis <https://evanthebouncy.github.io/program-synthesis-minimal/>`_.

For a more in-depth understanding, we recommend following the following resources:

- `6.S981: Introduction to Program Synthesis <https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/SynthesisCourse/index.htm>`_
- `CS294: Program Synthesis for Everyone <https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/ucb/cs294fa12.html>`_.
- `Neurosymbolic Programming <https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/pubs/PGL-049-Plain.pdf>`_.


Installation
------------

The ``neurosym`` library is distributed via
`pypi <https://pypi.org/project/neurosym/>`__. Simply run the following
command to install the ``neurosym`` package and all dependencies:

.. code:: bash

   pip install neurosym
