        :: DSL

        A DSL for mutable arithmetic combinators. This DSL is a simple example of a DSL
        that uses mutable state to implement arithmetic combinators. The combinators
        include addition, multiplication, evenness checking, and if-then-else.

        The one parameterized function is `count`, which increments a counter each time
        it is called.

        The purpose of this DSL is to test the ability of the DSL to handle mutable state.
