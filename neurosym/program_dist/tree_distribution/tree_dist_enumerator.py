"""
We want to enumerate programs as trees. Specifically, we have some distribution
    P(tree) = prod_{node in tree} P(node | ancestors(node)[:limit]).

Here, limit is a value that the distribution guarantees us. This is useful
    because we can use this to optimize our enumeration algorithm (since it
    reduces the amount of memory we need to save for each hole).

Our algorithm here is based on iterative deepening. We have a method that
    keeps a minimum and maximum likelihood, and enumerates all programs
    that are within this likelihood range.

Likelihood is defined as the log probability of the program.
