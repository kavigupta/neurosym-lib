### LAPS-DreamCoder library
An importable library module containing program synthesis utilities and data structures. Initially developed for LAPS (Wong et. al 2021). 
using the DreamCoder program synthesis library from (Ellis et. al 2021). 
The original repository is derived from [the icml_2021_supplement release of the EC repo](https://github.com/ellisk42/ec/tree/icml_2021_supplement).

USAGE: this submodule needs to be in a directory called ```dreamcoder``` in order to preserve import structure.

### Building the Ocaml binaries.
We use the updated, OCaml-locked installation at: https://github.com/mlb2251/dreamcoder.
To build the Ocaml binaries from scratch, you can follow `Build the OCaml binaries.`
